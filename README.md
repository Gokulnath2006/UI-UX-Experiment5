# UI-UX-Experiment5

## Aim:
To Present 2 different UX project scenarios (e.g., designing a health app, an e-commerce site, or a government service portal).

## Algorithm:

1. Select a UX project scenario (e.g., health app or e-commerce site).
2. **Identify** key user pain points through observation or assumptions.
3. **Write** 1–2 problem statements using the template:
   *"[User] needs a way to [goal] because [obstacle], which results in [impact]."*
4. **Choose** suitable research methods (e.g., surveys, interviews, usability testing) and justify them.
5. **Create** 1–2 user personas including demographics, goals, behaviors, pain points, and motivations.

## Output:
```
 Scenario 1: Designing a Health & Fitness App

 1. Identifying and Writing Problem Statements

 User Pain Points

* Users find it hard to stay consistent with exercise routines.
* Many apps are overloaded with data but lack personalized workout suggestions.
* Users struggle to track progress in a motivating and simple way.

 UX Problem Statements

1. *“Health-conscious users need a way to receive personalized workout plans because generic routines don’t fit their goals, which results in loss of motivation and irregular exercise habits.”*
2. *“Busy professionals need a way to monitor their daily fitness activities because they lack time for manual tracking, which results in poor progress awareness and unhealthy lifestyles.”*


 2. Identifying Appropriate Research Methods

 Chosen Methods:

* User Interviews: To understand individual motivations, challenges, and preferences related to fitness tracking.
* Surveys: To gather broader quantitative data on user habits, app usage frequency, and preferred features.
* Usability Testing (Prototype Stage): To test the ease of use and engagement level of the app interface.

 Justification:

* Interviews help uncover emotional and behavioral insights.
* Surveys provide measurable trends across a wide group.
* Usability testing ensures the app is intuitive before development.
